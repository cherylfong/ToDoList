## Notes

Hours spent: 1-2 hrs

There were no significant challenges that I've encountered up to this point in building this applicantion. I did find this [blog](https://blog.cindypotvin.com/saving-data-to-a-file-in-your-android-application/) useful in helping me understand caching files in the internal memory of an app and in implementing persistence using this method.
